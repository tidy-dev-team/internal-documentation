# **Component description scheme** _(subject to change)_

**Component documentation consists of the following elements:**

1. Information sections
2. Tags
3. Misprint

Feel free to add as many elements as needed, but maintain the structure described below. If you add new emojis, include them in the "Currently Defined Sections" list.

**General structure:**

- All elements in the description are separated by empty lines (double enter).
- **Misprint** always placed first (maybe optional).
- **Tags** are placed second (maybe optional).

**Element structure:**

1. Information sections:
   1. Every sections starts with title line
   2. Title line includes:
      - emoji (mandatory)
      - text (optional)
   3. The content of the section starts on the second line.
   4. Currently defined sections:
      - ℹ️ \- component information
      - 🗂 \- section to which component belongs to
2. Tags:
   1. Start with “\#” symbol
   2. Separate tags by spaces, tabs, or place each one on a separate line.

## **Example (icon button):**

Compact buttons that display only an icon, often used for common actions where space is limited.
